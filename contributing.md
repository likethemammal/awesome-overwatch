# Contribution Guidelines

If you've found links, projects, or demos that should be on this list, contributing is welcome!

The goal is visibility.

### Projects right for this list

- For creative projects and tools, stick to Codepen (or any major sandbox) and Github repos. Avoid linking to individual websites, see below.
- No guides, sites, or video channels
- Avoid linking to guides, how to videos, etc. The community already has many places for that type of content and a decent portion is based on opinion and prone to debate.
- Avoid linking to sites. These are general community resources which are easily findable, adding them to this list would encourage pull-requests just to promote random site. If you really want a site included, make a Github repo for it.

### Pull Requests

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

Thank you for your suggestions!
